This is an EDA project that aims to explore and analyze Netflix's original programming to understand the distribution of genres, trends in release years, and patterns in runtime and episodes/seasons, different languages, etc. The objective is to present these insights in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The dataset used in this project (netflix programming.csv) was created by web scraping [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_programming) an article about current and upcoming original series and related specials on Netflix.

This EDA project is about answering these questions:

  1. What are the Netflix release years?
  2. What are the most popular genres of shows on Netflix?
  3. What are the top 5 languages of shows on Netflix?
  4. What is the number of shows released in the past 5 years by language?
  5. What is the most popular time to release a show?
  6. What are the shows with the largest number of seasons and episodes?
  7. What is the distribution of average runtime? Which shows have the minimum/maximum runtime?
  8. What are the top 10 genres of upcoming shows?
  9. What are the top 5 languages of upcoming shows?
  10. What are the top genres of shows in development?


Through several visualizations such as pie charts, bars and heatmaps, we noticed that there is a focus on drama content which was predominant among genres. English is the primary language for shows with nearly the half programming in English, but other languages like Spanish and Korean are gaining prominence. The shows with the shortest runtimes, ranging from 10 to 20 minutes, span a wide array of genres including preschool content, comedy, fantasy, and science fiction. This diversity highlights the versatility of short-form content and its appeal to various audiences. When the most programmings with maximum runtime are Reality shows, i.e. competitions, datings, Live events and so on.
